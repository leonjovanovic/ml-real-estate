# Machine learning application in predicting prices of real estate

## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to predict prices of real estates for sale in Belgrade, Serbia. Learning process was done by linear regression and kNN algorithms.
  * First, it was necessary to create web crawler which will scrape real estates from various websites. 
  * Secondly, we needed to write a Python scripts to preprocess data. 
  * Thirdly, we used MySQL and Python scripts to generate queries and plots. 
  * Finally, we used Python to create linear regression and kNN and generate prediction.

## Visualization
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get more general sense of real estates, six graphs were created.
- Top 10 most popular districts in Belgrade by number of real estates

- Top 10 most popular districts in Belgrade by number of real estates

- Flats by number of square footage

- Real estates by year of construction

- For sale/rent by city

- Price of real estates divided in six groups

- Real estate with/without parking in Belgrade
